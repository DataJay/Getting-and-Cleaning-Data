Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
=========================
This is for the Coursera online course "Getting and Cleaning Data"
This is the Course Project.

CODE GOALS:
This R code, entitled "run_analysis.R" is designed to perform the following actions:
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

SETUP:  The data files that this code operates on must be downloaded and extracted into a local working directory.
The orginal file structure must remain intact, do not rename or move around data files.  
Launch R, set your working directory to where you've placed the files, and run the code.

OUTPUT:  The code will create a text file called "Tidy.txt" in your working directory. 
It will also keep in session the final Tidy data frame.

DATA SOURCE:
The data can be downloaded here in zipped format:
